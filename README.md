# CPU

> **Here I've created a "little" computer architecture with a compiler that can handle any simple task**

It's created by [Logisim evolution](https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution), a simple simulation program that allows you to design a large project with simple elements such as logic gates (AND, NOR...), multiplexers, registers, etc.

Every component, including ALU, CU, CONTROLLER, and etc. is created by hand

Aside from that architecture, I also created an assembly language with specific commands, so that you can write any simple task with it

Take a look at each of the files we have to better understand how these things work
1. **myCPU.circ** - Logisim file with all of these architectures and circuits 
2. **Instructions.xlsx** - In an Excel document, I explained what commands we have and what the options are for operands.<br> Most commands consist of three parameters: [operation] [operand1] [operand2] <br> You can also see an example of the collatz_conjecture code (which runs in that video above) with descriptions of each line

4. **evenOdd.txt** - The program is written here. <br> in this case, I wrote code for the collatz_conjecture problem which suggests that repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually result in every positive integer becoming 1. <br> 
these operations are 
- If the number is even, divide it by two.
- If the number is odd, triple it and add one. <br>
You can find more information in the excel file where I commented on each line of code.

7. **compilator.ipynb** - A Python file that converts a code file into an array that will be written in instructions.txt. 
8. **instructions.txt** - This is the code generated by the compiler that should be added to the ram inside Logisim simulation (you can click edit on RAM and paste this hex code there)
