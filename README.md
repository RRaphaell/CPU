# CPU

> Here created a "little" computer architecture with compilator that can handle any simple task

It's created by [Logisim evolution](https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution) a simple simulation program that allows you to create such a large project with simple elements, <br> like logic gates (AND, NOR...), multiplexers, registers, etc. 

each section, such as ALU, CU, CONTROLLER, is created by hand

besides that architecture, I created simple assembly language with specific commands and also a script

let's explore each of the file that we have to get more general view how does this things work
1. **myCPU.circ** - logisim file where I have all of this architecture and circuits 
2. **Instructions.xlsx** - excel file of instructions where I described what commands we have. <br>  what is the options for operands, all register names. and also code description for collatz_conjecture problem

</p>

4. **evenOdd.txt** - this is where the code is written. we write 3 in register A and add some logic here. <br> like what should be done if number is even or odd. <br> see excel file for more description there I commented each line of code

7. **compilator.ipynb** - python file which takes code txt file and converts it into hex array that will be write in instructions.txt 
8. **instruqtions.txt** - code generated by compiler which should be added into ram inside logisim simulation (you can click edit on RAM and paste this hex codes there)
